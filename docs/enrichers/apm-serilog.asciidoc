=== APM Serilog Enricher

This enricher adds the transaction id and trace id to every Serilog log message that is created during a transaction.

==== Installation

Add a reference to the http://nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Apm.SerilogEnricher[Elastic.Apm.SerilogEnricher] package:

[source,xml]
[subs="attributes"]
----
<PackageReference Include="Elastic.Apm.SerilogEnricher" Version="{ecs-logging-dotnet-version}" />
----

==== Usage 

[source,csharp]
----
var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
   .Enrich.WithElasticApmCorrelationInfo()
   .WriteTo.Console(outputTemplate: "[{ElasticApmTraceId} {ElasticApmTransactionId} {ElasticApmSpanId} {Message:lj} {NewLine}{Exception}")
   .CreateLogger();
----

==== Properties

In the code snippet above `Enrich.WithElasticApmCorrelationInfo()` enables the enricher from this project,
which will set 3 properties for log lines that are created during a transaction:

* `ElasticApmTraceId`
* `ElasticApmTransactionId`
* `ElasticApmSpanId`

These two properties are printed to the Console using the `outputTemplate` parameter, of course they can
be used with any sink, you could consider using a filesystem sink and
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat[Elastic Filebeat] for durable and reliable ingestion.
This enricher is also compatible with the
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.CommonSchema.Serilog[Elastic.CommonSchema.Serilog] package.

==== Prerequisite

The prerequisite for this to work is a configured https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet[Elastic APM Agent].
If the agent is not configured the enricher won't add anything to the logs.
