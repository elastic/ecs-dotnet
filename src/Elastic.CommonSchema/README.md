# Elastic Common Schema .NET

The `Elastic.CommonSchema` project contains a full C# representation of [Elastic Common Schema](https://github.com/elastic/ecs) (ECS) - see [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html).

The intention is that this library forms a reliable and correct basis for integrations into Elasticsearch, that use both Microsoft .NET and ECS.

These types can be used in either as-is, or in conjunction with, the [Official .NET clients for Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net). The types are annotated with the corresponding `DataMember` attributes, enabling out-of-the-box serialisation support with the Elasticsearch.net clients.

## Packages

The .NET assemblies are published to NuGet under the package name [Elastic.CommonSchema](http://nuget.org/packages/Elastic.CommonSchema)

The master branch pushes new NuGet packages on successful CI builds to https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/ecs-dotnet

## Versioning

The version of the Elastic.CommonSchema package matches the published ECS version, with the same corresponding branch names:

 - Nested Schema (The C# types are generated from this YAML file): https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/v1.4.0/generated/ecs/ecs_nested.yml
 - .NET types: https://github.com/elastic/ecs-dotnet/tree/v1.4.0

The version numbers of the NuGet package must match the exact version of ECS used within Elasticsearch. Attempting to use mismatched versions, for example a NuGet package with version 1.2.0 against an Elasticsearch index configured to use an ECS template with version 1.1.0, will result in indexing and data problems.

## Getting started

### Installing

You can install Elastic.CommonSchema from the package manager console:

    PM> Install-Package Elastic.CommonSchema

Alternatively, simply search for Elastic.CommonSchema in the package manager UI.

### Usage

#### Client Installation

In this example, we will also install the [Elasticsearch.net Low Level Client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net#elasticsearchnet) and use this to perform the HTTP communications with our Elasticsearch server.

    PM> Install-Package Elasticsearch.Net

#### Connecting to Elasticsearch

```csharp
var node = new Uri("http://localhost:9200");
var config = new ConnectionConfiguration(node);
var lowLevelClient = new ElasticLowLevelClient(config);
```
#### Creating an Index Template

Now we need to put an index template, so that any new indices that match our configured index name pattern are to use ECS.

We ship with different index templates for different major versions of Elasticsearch within the `Elastic.CommonSchema.Elasticsearch` namespace.

```csharp
// We are using Elasticsearch version 7.4.0, lets use a 7 version index template
var template = Elastic.CommonSchema.Elasticsearch.IndexTemplates.GetIndexTemplateForElasticsearch7("ecs-*");

// Send the template to the Elasticsearch server
var templateResponse = lowLevelClient.Indices.PutTemplateForAll<StringResponse>("ecs-template", template);
   
// Check everything was successful
Debug.Assert(templateResponse.Success);
```

Now that we have applied the index template, any indices that match the pattern `ecs-*` will use ECS.

NOTE: We only need to apply the index template once.

#### Creating an ECS event

Creating a new ECS event is as simple as newing up an instance:

```csharp
var ecsEvent = new Base
{
    Timestamp = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2019-10-23T19:44:38.485Z"),
    Dns = new Dns
    {
        Id = "23666",
        OpCode = "QUERY",
        Type = "answer",
        Question = new DnsQuestion
        {
             Name   = "www.example.com",
             Type = "A",
             Class = "IN",
             RegisteredDomain = "example.com"
        },
        HeaderFlags = new [] { "RD", "RA" },
        ResponseCode = "NOERROR",
        ResolvedIp = new [] { "10.0.190.47", "10.0.190.117" },
        Answers = new []
        {
            new DnsAnswers
            {
                Data = "10.0.190.47",
                Name = "www.example.com",
                Type = "A",
                Class = "IN",
                Ttl = 59
            },
            new DnsAnswers
            {
                Data = "10.0.190.117",
                Name = "www.example.com",
                Type = "A",
                Class = "IN",
                Ttl = 59
            }
        }
    },
    Network = new Network
    {
        Type = "ipv4",
        Transport = "udp",
        Protocol = "dns",
        Direction = "outbound",
        CommunityId = "1:19beef+RWVW9+BEEF/Q45VFU+2Y=",
        Bytes = 126
    },
    Source = new Source
    {
        Ip = "192.168.86.26",
        Port = 5785,
        Bytes = 31
    },
    Destination = new Destination
    {
        Ip = "8.8.4.4",
        Port = 53,
        Bytes = 95
    },
    Client = new Client
    {
        Ip = "192.168.86.26",
        Port = 5785,
        Bytes = 31
    },
    Server = new Server
    {
        Ip = "8.8.4.4",
        Port = 53,
        Bytes = 95
    },
    Event = new Event
    {
        Duration = 122433000,
        Start = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2019-10-23T19:44:38.485Z"),
        End = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2019-10-23T19:44:38.607Z"),
        Kind = "event",
        Category = "network_traffic"
    },
    Ecs = new Ecs
    {
        Version = "1.2.0"
    },
    Metadata = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "client", "ecs-dotnet" }
    }
};
```

This can then be indexed into Elasticsearch:

```csharp
var indexResponse = lowLevelClient.Index<StringResponse>(index,PostData.Serializable(ecsEvent));

// Check everything was successful
Debug.Assert(indexResponse.Success);
```

Congratulations, you are now using the Elastic Common Schema!

#### A note on the `Metadata` property

The C# `Base` type includes a property called `Metadata` with the signature:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Container for additional metadata against this event.
/// </summary>
[DataMember(Name = "_metadata")]
public IDictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; set; }
```

This property is not part of the ECS specification, but is included as a means to index supplementary information.

#### Advanced metadata storage

In instances where using the `IDictionary<string, object> Metadata` property is not sufficient, or there is a clearer definition of the structure of the ECS-compatible document you would like to index, it is possible to subclass the `Base` object and provide your own property definitions.

The Elastic.CommonSchema.BenchmarkDotNetExporter project takes this approach, in the [Domain source directory](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-dotnet/tree/master/src/Elastic.CommonSchema.BenchmarkDotNetExporter), where the BenchmarkDocument subclasses Base.
